## **Known Issues & Fixes**

This section documents identified issues and their planned fixes for improved user experience across all platforms.

### **Mobile iOS Formatting Issues**

#### **Issue: Layout Breaking Past "The Journey" Section**
- **Component**: `src/components/LifeJourney.tsx`
- **Problem**: iOS Safari viewport handling causes layout shifts and spacing issues after the timeline section
- **Root Cause**: CSS viewport units (`vh`) behave inconsistently on iOS, especially with Safari's dynamic toolbar
- **Impact**: Timeline cards may overflow, text becomes misaligned, and scroll behavior becomes erratic
- **Planned Fix**: 
  - Replace `h-screen-safe` classes with iOS-compatible viewport calculations
  - Implement `dvh` (dynamic viewport height) units with fallbacks
  - Add iOS-specific media queries for Safari browser detection
  - Optimize touch scroll behavior for timeline navigation

#### **Issue: Responsive Breakpoint Inconsistencies**
- **Component**: Global layout system
- **Problem**: Tailwind responsive classes don't account for iOS Safari's collapsing address bar
- **Planned Fix**: Custom CSS variables for true viewport dimensions on iOS

### **Contact Section Issues**

#### **Issue: Phone Number Exposure in Let's Connect Section**
- **Component**: `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 228-240)
- **Problem**: Phone number `(647) 710-2061` publicly exposed in both desktop and mobile versions
- **Security Concern**: Direct phone access can lead to spam and privacy issues
- **Planned Fix**: 
  - Remove phone number card completely from contact grid
  - Restructure contact grid from 5 items to 4 items (Resume, Email, LinkedIn, GitHub)
  - Implement CSS Grid auto-fit for better responsive layout
  - Consider adding a contact form as alternative communication method

#### **Issue: Portfolio Button Should Link to Resume Instead of Website**
- **Component**: `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 170-183)
- **Current Behavior**: Portfolio button links to `https://ethanurbanky.dev` (the current website)
- **Problem**: Circular reference - portfolio linking to itself is not useful for visitors
- **Planned Fix**:
  - Change Portfolio button to "Resume" with document icon (ðŸ“„)
  - Update href to `/resume.pdf` for direct PDF download
  - Change descriptive text from "ethanurbanky.dev" to "Download PDF"
  - Add `download="Ethan_Urbanky_Resume.pdf"` attribute for better file naming
  - Ensure resume.pdf is placed in `/public/` directory for proper serving

### **Story Timeline Issues**

#### **Issue: "Leadership & Growth" Story Point Formatting**
- **Component**: `src/components/LifeJourney.tsx` (line 53)
- **Problem**: Inconsistent spacing and typography hierarchy in the story card
- **Details**: 
  - Title uses ampersand which may not render consistently across fonts
  - Card padding doesn't match other timeline entries
  - Stats grid alignment issues on mobile devices
- **Planned Fix**:
  - Standardize title formatting with consistent character encoding
  - Normalize card padding using CSS custom properties
  - Implement responsive stats grid with `minmax()` for consistent spacing
  - Add typography scale consistency checks

### **Tech Constellation Component Issues**

#### **Issue: Proficiency Percentage Display**
- **Component**: `src/components/SkillConstellation.tsx` (line 217)
- **Problem**: Displaying raw proficiency percentages may appear boastful or inaccurate
- **Current Code**: `{skill.level}% proficiency`
- **Planned Fix**: 
  - Replace percentage with skill level descriptors: "Expert", "Advanced", "Proficient", "Familiar"
  - Create mapping function: 90-100% = "Expert", 80-89% = "Advanced", etc.
  - Improve tooltip visual hierarchy with better typography

#### **Issue: Tooltip Popup Positioning and Performance**
- **Component**: `src/components/SkillConstellation.tsx` (lines 208-225)
- **Problems**:
  - Collision detection is simplified and can cause overlapping tooltips
  - Mobile touch interactions don't properly dismiss tooltips
  - Z-index conflicts with other UI elements
  - Performance issues with hover states on mobile devices
- **Planned Fixes**:
  - Implement proper collision detection using element bounds
  - Add touch-friendly tap-to-show/hide tooltip behavior
  - Create tooltip manager with proper z-index stacking
  - Add viewport boundary detection to prevent tooltips from going off-screen
  - Implement tooltip queuing system for mobile devices

### **Content and UX Issues**

#### **Issue: Sentence Clarity and Flow**
- **Components**: Various throughout the portfolio
- **Problems Identified**:
  - Technical jargon without sufficient context for non-technical audiences
  - Long sentences that could be broken down for better readability
  - Inconsistent tone between sections (academic vs. professional vs. casual)
- **Planned Improvements**:
  - Rewrite technical descriptions with broader audience appeal
  - Break complex sentences into digestible chunks
  - Standardize tone to professional yet approachable
  - Add progressive disclosure for technical details

#### **Issue: Spacing Between "Ready for What's Next" and Tech Constellation**
- **Components**: `src/components/LifeJourney.tsx` (lines 233-239) and `src/app/page.tsx` (line 152)
- **Problem**: Insufficient visual separation causing sections to feel cramped
- **Details**:
  - LifeJourney final message doesn't have enough bottom padding
  - Skills section lacks proper top margin
  - Snap scroll behavior can cause jarring transitions
- **Planned Fix**:
  - Add consistent section padding using CSS custom properties
  - Implement smooth transition zones between major sections
  - Optimize snap scroll points for better flow
  - Add visual separators or gradient transitions between sections

### **Performance and Accessibility Fixes**

#### **Issue: Animation Performance on Lower-End Devices**
- **Components**: Particle systems, constellation connections, timeline animations
- **Planned Optimizations**:
  - Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` respect
  - Add performance budgets for animation complexity
  - Provide fallback static layouts for devices with limited GPU acceleration

#### **Issue: Keyboard Navigation and Screen Reader Support**
- **Components**: Interactive elements throughout
- **Planned Improvements**:
  - Add proper ARIA labels and descriptions
  - Implement keyboard navigation patterns
  - Ensure proper focus management in dynamic content
  - Add skip links for complex interactive sections
